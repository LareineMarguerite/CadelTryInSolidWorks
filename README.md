# CadelTryInSolidWorks
Trying to make a cad model for Cable-driven parallel robot
1st edition. The model is built in Solidworks 2016. Unsolved problems are: there are no constrains for inversion and Eversion; the actual actuation cables were not built. 
The main reference is the article "Analysis of a Wearable Robotic System for Ankle Rehabilitation" written by Matteo Russo and Marco Ceccarelli.
